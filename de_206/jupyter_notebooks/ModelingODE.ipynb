    "# Exploration: Concentration Variation in a Reactor with Periodic Feed Concentration\n",
    "\n",
    "A plug flow reactor (PFR) operates with a reactant feed whose concentration varies periodically as it flows through the reactor at a constant velocity \\($v$\\). The concentration, $C(t)$, of the reactant at a fixed position along the reactor is governed by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$80 \\frac{dC}{dt} + 10,000 \\, C = 2,500 \\cos\\left( \\frac{\\pi v t}{6} \\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $C(t)$ is the reactant concentration (in mol/L),\n",
    "- the term \\[$80 \\frac{dC}{dt}$\\] represents the accumulation of concentration due to flow and reaction kinetics,\n",
    "- and the right side forcing term \\[$2,500 \\cos\\left( \\frac{\\pi v t}{6} \\right)$\\] represents the periodic variation in feed concentration entering the reactor, with frequency proportional to the fluid velocity \\($v$\\)."
